A gold bar/blue box drop logger for Granblue Fantasy.

![Dorothy UI](https://github.com/NadyaNayme/Dorothy/blob/master/src/gui/images/dorothy_ui.png?)

## How to Use
Left click the +1 to add a drop or right click it to subtract a drop. Don't forget to eat your crayons.

## Settings

- **Always On Top**: When checked will make the Dorothy window always stay on top of other windows (unless those windows are also set to Always On Top)
- **Reset Counts on Export**: Resets drop counts to "0" on export.
- **Percentage of Total Chests**: Calculate drop percentages out of all chests instead of only blue chests
