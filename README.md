# Dorothy
A gold bar/blue box drop logger for Granblue Fantasy.

## How to Use
Click the +1 to add a drop and the -1 to subtract a drop. Don't forget to eat your crayons.

## Settings
In the `db/log.ini` file change `only_blues=1` to `only_blues=0` if you want to track drop rate across total logged kills instead of total blue chest drops.
