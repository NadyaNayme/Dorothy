A gold bar/blue box drop logger for Granblue Fantasy.

![Dorothy UI](https://github.com/NadyaNayme/Dorothy/blob/master/src/gui/images/dorothy_ui.png?)

## How to Use
Left click the +1 to add a drop or right click it to subtract a drop. Don't forget to eat your crayons.

## Settings
Export will also reset your count unless you set `"no_reset"` to `"1"` in the `/db/log.ini` file. To calculate percentage for all kills instead of only blue chests set `"only_blues"` to `"0"` in the `/db/log.ini` file. Eventually there will be a settings page to change these but for now you need to manually change them.
